"""usb-audio.py — a UAC2 audio-streaming IN endpoint added to the usb-midi
composite: at high speed the eight tracks as sixteen channels (track N's L/R
on channels 2N-1/2N, post-FX, pre-fader), at full speed their stereo sum, all
44.1 kHz 16-bit.

Unlike usb-midi (which revived dormant firmware), there is NO audio-streaming
code in the OS, and the new code (four grown config descriptors + the EP3 iso
servicing + a 36 KB audio ring) is far larger than the ~408 B of image free
space usb-midi leaves. So the payload lives on the CF card as /USBAUDIO.BIN
and is loaded at runtime into flex-heap pages that stage2 takes out of the
firmware's free list (--heap-reserve), where nothing else will ever be placed.

Pieces assembled here:

- custom/coldfire/usb-audio.s (the payload, position-independent via a
  relocation table): stage2 runtime installer, the SET/GET_INTERFACE + EP0
  clock-request + usb_isr + descriptor-clamp shims, the per-block producer,
  the iso packet builder, and the four grown UAC2 configs (generated below as
  an assembly include). Written to the card as /USBAUDIO.BIN.
- custom/coldfire/usb-audio-tramp.s (trampoline, linked into the 408 B image
  slack after usb-midi's overlay): hooks fs_card_detect_poll, and once the
  card is mounted loads the payload, invalidates the I-cache, and jsr's
  stage2.
- custom/coldfire/usb-audio-{alloc,report,guard}.s: the page allocator, the
  on-screen status reporter, and the image-resident hook guard, each in its
  own measured free zone.

Only a few in-image writes land here, all expect()-guarded: those blobs in
their free zones and the 6-byte jmp into fs_card_detect_poll. Everything else
the payload needs is installed AT RUNTIME by stage2 (into image code, but only
after the card blob is confirmed loaded — so an image without the card file
is exactly the stock usb-midi composite).

Usage (the Makefile passes the shipping flags, USBAUDIO_FLAGS):
  custom/usb-audio.py --in IMAGE.os --out IMAGE.os [--payload out/USBAUDIO.BIN]
                      --heap-reserve N --load-base ADDR --dma-at ADDR
