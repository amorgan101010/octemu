| usb-audio.s — the USB-audio payload, loaded from the CF card into flex-heap
| pages the firmware no longer believes exist (custom/usb-audio.py).
|
| Copied there at runtime by custom/coldfire/usb-audio-tramp.s, this holds
| everything too large for the image's free space: the four grown UAC2 config
| descriptors (generated into usb-audio-cfg.s by custom/usb-audio.py), the
| SET/GET_INTERFACE + EP0 clock-request + usb_isr + descriptor-clamp shims,
| and the EP3 iso packet builder that streams the eight tracks to the host as
| SIXTEEN channels at 44.1 kHz 16-bit (track 1 L/R on channels 1/2 ... track 8
| L/R on 15/16) at high speed, or their stereo sum at full speed.
|
| stage2 installs every image hook AT RUNTIME (expect-guarded, D-cache pushed

| UAC2_AC_IFACE / UAC2_AS_IFACE / UAC2_CLOCK_ID (the audio function's
| interface numbers and clock entity, shared with the descriptor generator).

| ---- the audio source: the post-FX readback arena, which EXISTS ON HARDWARE -
| ☠ This used to read a ring that only `-M octatrack,audio-tap=on` ever wrote
| (QEMU mirroring the DSP's ESAI TX, which no CPU on a real board can see). A
| unit running that build had no producer at all. The source here is
| readback_buf: the eDMA deposits every track's post-FX, pre-fader block into
| SRAM each frame, on silicon as in the emulator, and it is the same memory
| the RECEIVE machine sums — confirmed working on real hardware.
|
| Layout: RB_BASE + prev*1024 + track*128 + frame*8, two 32-bit words (L,R)
| per frame, 16 frames per block, 8 tracks. Reads use the PREVIOUS bank
| (the pipeline is one block deep).
|
| The arena holds the eight tracks SEPARATELY and the stream carries them that
| way: one stereo pair per track. Measured, not assumed — with the fixture's
| SINE440 trigged on track 1, `OCTA_RB_LOG=1` shows slot 0 peaking at 2.7e8
| while tracks 2-8 hold a constant idle 768, in both ping-pong banks.
|
| ☠ Every pair is PRE-FADER: track level, the crossfader and MAIN volume are
| downstream of it, and the master track's processing happens inside the DSP
| where no CPU can read it. These are the tracks' post-FX signals, not a
| recording of what the MAIN jacks emit.
|
| ☠ A track whose machine is RECEIVE carries whatever that machine is summing,
| not a signal of its own — that is the routing the user asked for, and it is
| what the arena holds.

| ---- frame geometry --------------------------------------------------------
| The producer fills TWO rings per frame: a 32-byte slot (16 channels of s16
| LE, track 1 L/R first, track 8 L/R last) for the HIGH SPEED stream, and a
| 4-byte stereo sum of the eight tracks for FULL SPEED. Both are indexed by
| the same frame count, so the wrap arithmetic has one form.
|
| ☠ Why the speed decides the channel count: 16 ch at 44.1 kHz / 16 bit is
| 1411 B per millisecond, and a full-speed iso endpoint may move at most 1023 B
| per 1 ms frame, with no faster poll to escape into. Sixteen channels cannot
| be described at full speed at all. High speed polls every 500 us
| (bInterval 3), where 22.05 frames * 32 B = 706 B fits a single transaction
| under the 1024 B cap with room for the servo. ☠ UAC1 cannot poll faster
| than 1 ms even at high speed (Apple TN3190: bInterval must be 4), which
| caps a UAC1 stream at 11 channels; this is why the descriptors are UAC2.

| The payload's own audio rings. ☠ They live INSIDE the blob, as reserved
| space, so they move with the code when the loader relocates: there is no
| second address to verify, and they cannot collide with the sample heap
| because the heap itself handed us the memory. 1024 frames — 23 ms of
| buffer, ample between a ~2756/s producer and a 2 kHz consumer. ☠ A slot is
| eight times the size it was when the stream was stereo, so the frame COUNT
| came down to keep the blob inside the trampoline's 64 KB limit: 1024 * 32 B
| is 32 KB of ring (+4 KB for the stereo sum), and the whole payload lands
| around 50 KB. ☠ Only the CPU ever reads these rings — the USB controller
| reads the packet buffers in the cache-inhibited DMA window — so the rings
| need no cache maintenance at all.

| ---- self-relocating entry (POSITION INDEPENDENT) ------------------------
| ☠ The loader no longer picks a fixed address: it asks the firmware's page
| allocator for memory, so the payload cannot know at build time where it will
| run. This prologue is the only part that must work at any address, so it
| touches memory ONLY through a base register derived from its own PC. It then
| fixes up the self-references listed in the header and calls the real stage2,
| which may go back to plain absolute addressing.
|
| ☠ The heap is CACHEABLE COPYBACK (ACR0 covers 0x40000000-0x47ffffff), unlike
| the old cache-inhibited scratch. Relocation writes CODE, so the dirty data
| lines must be pushed and the instruction cache invalidated before any of it
| is executed, or the CPU fetches the pre-relocation bytes.
|
| Header (at base): +0 magic, +4 length, +8 checksum, +12 entry offset,

    |
    | usb_attach is USB DISK MODE's routine, and DISK MODE's contract is that

    | (PRESETS, the Sets) came back as zero-byte entries. It also wedges the
    | machine before the UI in the emulator, which is how the gate caught it.
    |
    | A host holding stale descriptors is a nuisance; replugging the cable
    | fixes it. Corrupting the user's card is not a trade worth making. If

| ---- SET_INTERFACE shim (installed at 0x4001dd04) ---------------------------
| Displaced: movel 0xfc0b01c4,%d0. Interface 4 (AudioStreaming) records the
| requested alt setting and completes the status stage; any other interface
| falls through to the stock handler unchanged.
|
| ☠ The shim RECORDS the request. Everything that builds EP3 state — the
| queue head, the dTDs, ENDPTCTRL3, the ring cursors — is done by the frame
| ISR (audio_ep3_up / audio_ep3_down), the one context that also queues
| packets. This runs from the USB interrupt; if it re-initialized the
| endpoint itself, a SET_INTERFACE landing in the middle of a kick would
| rewrite a queue the kick was still building, and the kick would then prime
| the remains. One owner, one byte of shared state.
|
| The one exception is alt 0's FLUSH, done here as well: the host may send
| its next IN within microseconds of the status stage, before the frame ISR
| has had its block, and a packet already queued would answer it — audio
| after teardown. A flush only cancels what is in flight, is idempotent, and
| builds nothing, so it is safe from this context; the kick checks the
| request byte before it queues, so nothing new follows it; and the frame
| ISR flushes again on its way down. (The audio-alt gate asserts silence
| after alt 0, and caught the deferred-only version.)
|
| ☠ Interrupt levels, from the firmware's own INTC writes: the USB interrupt
| is INTC1 source 47 at level 4 (moveq #4 / moveb ->0xfc04c06f at
| 0x4001e024); the frame IRQ is EPORT IRQ1 at level 5 (0x4001fc30). So the
| frame ISR can preempt this shim — harmless, it only ever sees the request
| byte — but this shim can NEVER interrupt a kick. The single-owner rule is
| belt and braces over that fact, not a substitute for it.

| A descriptor whose buffer crosses a 4 KB page then transmits only the bytes
| before the boundary and zeros after. The grown UAC2 config straddles a page
| once the payload relocates into a heap page (the shipping load path), so the

| fills PAGE 1 = (buffer & ~0xfff) + 0x1000, so any EP0 descriptor send that
| spans a page boundary completes. It is load-address independent — the fix a

| Each packet holds the next n frames from the ring: n = 22/23 at high speed
| (2205/100 per packet) or 44/45 at full speed (4410/100), so the emitted
| stream is an exact, gap-free substring of what the producer wrote. Underrun
| queues nothing (the host's IN gets an empty packet); a producer that laps
| the ring (host stopped draining) resyncs and counts an overrun.
| Runs from the frame shim only; may clobber every register but %sp.
|
| ☠ TWO dTDs, so the host always finds a packet waiting. An isochronous IN
| cannot NAK: an IN token that arrives with nothing primed is answered with a
| zero-length packet, and a 22-frame hole in the stream is a click. With one
| dTD the packet for each 500 us poll had to be primed by the frame ISR after
| the previous poll completed — usually fine (blocks are 363 us apart), but
| any block-interrupt latency became a hole, and the ring's fill is the wrong
| cushion for that: it protects the producer, not the prime. With two, the
| ISR keeps one packet queued BEHIND the one in flight and the controller
| chains into it on its own. (An earlier two-deep attempt wedged against the
| bench, which walked linked iso dTDs as one bulk transfer; the bench now
| serves one dTD per poll, as silicon does.)

    | 0x4001d656 clears the token for exactly this reason; clearing the whole

| ---- UAC2 class-request shim (installed at 0x4001de64) ----------------------
| Displaced: movel 0xfc0b01c0,%d0 — the first instruction of the stock
| "unknown request: STALL EP0" tail, which every request the dispatcher does
| not recognise falls into. A UAC2 host asks the CLOCK SOURCE for its sample
| rate before it will publish a device (RANGE + CUR of CS_SAM_FREQ_CONTROL,
| CUR of CS_CLOCK_VALID_CONTROL, all class GET to the AudioControl interface
| with the entity id in wIndex's high byte), and a STALL there means no
| audio device. Everything else falls through to the stock STALL, which is
| the legal answer for a control we do not implement.
|
| Reply the way the stock string-descriptor path does: push the buffer and
| min(wLength, len) and jump to the shared usb_ep0_send tail. d2 still holds
| wLength here (nothing between the dispatcher and the stall touches it). The
| reply buffers are CONSTANTS in this blob: the EP0 send DMAs them straight
| out of memory, and the loader's cache push after relocation is the last
| time they may be written.

| ☠ Everything the USB controller reads by DMA lives OUTSIDE the payload blob,
| in cache-inhibited memory. The blob runs from flex heap pages, which ACR0
| maps cacheable copyback, and the controller is a bus master that does not
| snoop the CPU's data cache -- so a dTD written by the CPU can still be dirty
| in cache when the controller fetches it, and the controller then reads
| whatever RAM held before. That presented exactly as measured on hardware:
| ENDPTPRIME clears (the prime was consumed) while ENDPTSTAT never arms (the
| descriptor it found was not ACTIVE). Per-line cpushl did NOT fix it, in
| either form; moving the structures out did, first try.
|
| The window is 0x4ec94a00..0x4ec95000 (--dma-at): past the controller's own
| 8-entry endpoint list (0x4ec94800 + 8*64) and below the firmware's dTD pool
| at 0x4ec95000, referenced by nothing in the image (scan 2026-09-22), and
| EXACTLY 1536 B: two 32-byte dTDs and two 736-byte packet buffers, one pair
| per queue slot.
